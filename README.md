# mars_anaylsis
Challenge 11

## Challenge Outputs
This activity uses SQLAlchemy and Flask to analysis weather conditions before leaving for a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii.

### Analysis:
(provided by school to verifying in correct data collection methods)
On average, the third month has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and the eighth month is the warmest. But it is always very cold there in human terms!

Atmospheric pressure is, on average, lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth.

The distance from peak to peak is roughly 1425-750, or 675 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 675 days from the plot. Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
